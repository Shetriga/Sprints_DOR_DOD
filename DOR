We can say that the story is ready to be taken into a sprint when it is:
  - Independent of all other stories
  - Valuable (delivers a certain value to our app)
  - Small (small enough to fit into a sprint)
  - Testable (Even if the test itself not ready yet)
  - Acceptance criteria for the story should be clearly defined
  - The person who will accept the user story after it is finished is identified
  - The development team is able to demonstrate the user story
